# set, ahead of pithead-boot. What that switch changes is small, and all of it is here or one line
# each in firstboot_wizard: the "this machine already has a role" short-circuits are skipped, the
# page is told what the machine is, and "Keep it" ends the session with nothing on /data touched.

# coordinator's form pre-fills from config.json through the reinstall rule (strip_config_secrets),
